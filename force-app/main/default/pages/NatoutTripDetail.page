                Please complete all fields in this form and add any explanatory notes for staff, subcommittee chairs, and/or collaborators in the comments section near the end of the form.
            </p>
            <p>
                The one section that may be completed later is Trip Brochure and Photos. You may submit this information with the trip or later, as long as they are in by the 
                <a href="https://community.sierraclub.org/file/2824/download" target="_blank">brochure submission deadline</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To save your progress and return to it later, press the Save button at the bottom of the form. You will receive a notification that the trip was successfully updated.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you are ready to submit your trip, change the Approval Status from Started to Submitted, then return to the end of the form and hit the Save button. The system will check for errors and missing information and notify you if there is anything that needs to be fixed before you can submit. Once the trip status has changed, you will receive a notification saying that the trip was successfully updated.
            </p>
            <p class="italic-font">
                Note: Once a trip has been approved by the chair or a brochure has been submitted, it cannot be changed in the TSS. If you have any trip changes at this point (staff, dates, budget, etc.), 
                you will need to contact the chair for approval. They will then notify Tony who will update the trip in our system.
                If you have any significant changes to your brochure (overview, itinerary, etc.), 
                you will need to run them by your chair and/or your subcommittee's brochure reviewer (if applicable). 
                Once approved, please give the edited version of your brochure a new name (e.g. "tripnumber_revised"), upload it in the TSS, and resubmit it.
            </p>
